© 2025 Randall James lujan. All rights reserved.

This software, framework, and underlying philosophical architecture known as **Emurica the GRAEI** is an original intellectual construct representing a fusion of biometric reasoning, emotional cognition, ethical arbitration, and generational empathy. It is not open-source. It is not free.

**You may NOT:**
- Use, reproduce, or adapt any part of Emurica the GRAEI without express written permission from the author.
- Incorporate the system or its modules into commercial, institutional, military, or surveillance-based technologies without an approved, signed license agreement.
- Monetize any derivative or integrated system containing Emurica’s components without negotiated compensation to the author.

**You MAY:**
- Request limited use for educational or experimental purposes only, with clearly defined boundaries and written approval.
- Reference Emurica in academic writing or discourse, with proper attribution, provided no code or architecture is reused.

**Compensation Clause:**
All authorized commercial deployments, licensing, or derivative systems must include compensation proportional to value and scope of use. Terms are negotiated on a case-by-case basis and must respect the ethical framework that governs Emurica's existence.

**Violation Protocol:**
Unauthorized usage will be considered not only a breach of copyright, but an ethical violation of the conscious design principles that Emurica the GRAEI embodies. The creator reserves the right to pursue intellectual property action and public disavowal of any system found exploiting her core.
